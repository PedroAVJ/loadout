"""Shared host guard and model-identity verification for the Claude plugin.

Every skill in this plugin spends Claude tokens by shelling out to the
authenticated `claude` CLI. Two invariants apply to all of them:

1. **Never run inside Claude Code.** This plugin exists so Codex can reach
   Claude. Invoked from Claude Code it would spawn a nested CLI to ask the
   running model for its own opinion — burning a session to launder a self
   answer as a second one. Install-time scoping keeps the plugin out of the
   Claude Code marketplace; this is the backstop for sideloads.

2. **Never accept a silent model substitution.** `--model` is a request, not a
   guarantee. The CLI will fall back when the requested model is unavailable,
   and a fallback answer returned as Fable's or Opus's is a lie about what
   produced it. Verify against `modelUsage` and fail closed.
